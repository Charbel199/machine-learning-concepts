# K-Nearest Neighbour

A KNN model calculates the distances between a point and its k nearest neighbours to determine its value / class.

Some common problems with choosing a K value:
* Choosing a large K value might lead to underfitting (Model does not properly learn)
* Choosing a small K value might lead to overfitting
